# Project VƒÅyu: Interactive News Headline Dashboard

An NLP project that analyzes over 200,000 news headlines and presents the findings in a fully interactive web application built with Streamlit.

---

##  Project Summary

This project transforms a static data analysis into a dynamic, interactive dashboard. It analyzes over 200,000 news headlines from the HuffPost (2012-2022) to uncover trends in public discourse. The final product is a web application where users can filter data by date and news category to explore sentiment, topic popularity, and key terms in real-time.

### Key Analyses Performed:
1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies each headline as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.
2.  **Topic Modeling:** Discovers the 10 most prominent hidden topics within the headlines.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Includes a trained model that can classify news categories from headline text.

##  Dashboard Features

* **Interactive Sidebar:** Filter the entire analysis by a specific **date range** or by selecting/deselecting **news categories**.
* **Dynamic Visualizations:** All charts (Sentiment Pie Chart, Topic Popularity, Word Cloud) update instantly based on user selections.
* **Key Metrics:** An overview panel showing the total number of headlines being analyzed based on the current filters.
* **Data Explorer:** An expandable table to view the raw, filtered data.
